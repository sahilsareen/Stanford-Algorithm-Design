Stanford-Algorithm-Design
=========================

This repository mainly includes the implementation of algorithms discussed in 
Stanford's coursera class on "Algorithms: Design and Analysis by Tim Roughgarden"
and some related algorithms I found on the web.


These programs may be helpful to those:
  1. Studying algorithms
  2. Preparing for interviews
  3. Learing python
